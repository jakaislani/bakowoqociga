When the wedding couple appeared together in Marietta on Saturday, his supporters and volunteers from the Georgia Federation of Democratic Women gave them their congratulations.</p><p>The Georgia Democrat’s contest with Karen Handel for the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives left vacant by Tom Price has drawn attention from throughout the country.</p><p>In a statement, Handel congratulated Ossoff and Kramer on their engagement and mentioned their 25-year marriage to Steve.</p><p>Ossoff, a former filmmaker who is now running for office, has had to get used to the spotlight of fame. Some have claimed that he appeared out of nowhere. The 27-year-old Kramer will soon be in the spotlight as well.</p><p>When CNN’s Alisyn Camerota asked Ossoff about his plans to get married during an interview, things began to move in that direction. Ossoff refused to discuss his personal life in any detail, but now his critics are claiming that the timing of his engagement is a political ploy.</p><p>You might be wondering who Alisha Kramer is now that she is prominently featured. Although we have asked Kramer for an interview, for the time being, here is what we can infer from social media and our own reporting:</p><p>She went to the same schools as Ossoff. So much for young love being short-lived. These two, who both attended Druid Hills’ autonomous pre-K through 12-year-old Paideia School, began dating when they were just teenagers. Before Ossoff graduated in 2008, Kramer began his studies at Georgetown. According to her LinkedIn profile, she studied Biology of Global Health there.</p><p>She has obviously traveled much. You c annot earn a degree in global health without also traveling abroad. As a Georgetown student, Kramer went on an exchange program to Denmark. Later, as a program coordinator and research assistant at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Global Health Policy Center, she would plan research trips or serve as the leader of delegations to places like Botswana, Switzerland, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Zambia. According to her author bio on the Impatient Optimists blog for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, her work focused on global health concerns such as HIV/AIDS, TB, and women’s health. She has also traveled to South America, stopping at Patagonia.</p><p>She has returned to school. Kramer, who is currently a student at Emory University School of Medicine where she is studying Obstetrics and Gynecology, is the daughter of a psychologist mother and an employment lawyer father. She intends to graduate in 2018. Ossoff is unable to cast his own ballot in the future election because of her schooling. For Kramer to commute to school each day, the couple decided to live close to Emory. Ossoff, therefore, does not currently reside in the sixth congressional district, but he recently told the AJC that he intends to do there as soon as Kramer finishes her education.</p><p>She enjoys playing Ultimate Frisbee. Kramer led her college’s Ultimate squad while also participating in the sport. She also wrote an essay to the College Women’s Ultimate Resource Manual. Ragnarok, an elite ultimate frisbee team in Copenhagen, Denmark, is a favorite of hers. Another love she has with her fiancé, who used to dabble in some Ultimate himself, is this one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpqjpWWppMJuusSem2asn2K4r7vWZpibp6Wpequ7zWamrKufm7O0ecaiqaWeop6yr7CMmqOiq5iWeqy%2BwKacq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
