It begins in comedy, it moves into realms of social observation, it descends into personal revelations that are sometimes tragic, sometimes comic, and then it ends in a way that turns everything back upon itself. The more you think about what Altman's done, the more impressive his accomplishment becomes.

Last sync: When spiders die, their tiny legs curl up tight against their body, because spiders don't use muscles to extend their legs. Why do spiders go belly up when they die? The most common explanation for why bugs die on their backs is something called the "position of flexion." When a bug is dead or dying, it cannot maintain tension in its leg muscles and naturally falls into a state of relaxation.</description></item><item><title>D.O.A. movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1988)</title><link>/doa-1988.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/doa-1988.html</guid><description>What all of the movies have in common is that the hero is passive and wants only to be left alone. But other people have other plans, and the hero is swept along by the tide. This is, of course, the classic definition of film noir, those 1940s thrillers in which ordinary people discovered the evil that lurked beneath the surface of society, and “D.O.A.” itself is inspired by a 1949 thriller starring Edmund O’Brien.</description></item><item><title>Josh Martinez Net Worth 2024</title><link>/josh-martinez-rapper-net-worth-242447.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/josh-martinez-rapper-net-worth-242447.html</guid><description>He has also released several mixtapes and EPs, including&amp;nbsp;The World Famous Sex Buffet (2009).

It's based on an actual bank robbery that took place in New York in the 1970s. And it seems to borrow, too, from that curious episode in Stockholm when hostages, barricaded in a bank vault with would-be robbers, began to identify with their captors. The presence of reporters and live TV cameras changed the nature of those events, helped to dictate them, made them into happenings with their own internal logic.</description></item><item><title>Flirt movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1996)</title><link>/flirt-1996.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/flirt-1996.html</guid><description>In each story, a character is about to leave town and asks a new lover: “Do we have a future together?” In each story, the new lover asks for time, and calls another lover, trying to decide between the two.
