And with an inclusive size range at more affordable prices than other high-end brands, why would you want to avoid it?&nbsp; “Skims offers one of the most comprehensive collections of shapewear styles on the market — whether you’re looking for a bodysuit, bra, or shorts you can find multiple styles to work with your outfits,” says a plus-size influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Tinsaye Berhanu</a>, who adds that the wide range of sizes and colors to match various skin tones sets the brand apart from the competition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s true, your jaw will drop after slipping into a figure-transforming bodysuit or a criminally soft pair of leggings. Since Kim K co-founded Skims five years ago, she’s expanded the shapewear line to over two dozen collections, including swimwear, pants, and dresses. There is so much to choose from, so we made things easier by highlighting our editor-approved and expert-recommended Skims products below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-skims-soft-lounge-long-slip-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Soft Lounge Long Slip Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom SKIMS Soft Lounge Long Slipdress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4oqL3UjFEl7yBVETyh3NMlG5v6M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-soft-lounge-long-slipdress-89eb55b4e43145db9dbe2d5bb77c217d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It accentuates curves and silhouettes for a beautiful fit whether you’re having a WFH or GNO moment.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s hard to find undergarments that won’t show through the dress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It only makes sense that the dress that broke the internet is by the woman with the same claim to fame. This lounge dress drew a lot of eyes, specifically from InStyle writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> who says that she feels “glorious at home” relaxing in its buttery soft fabric. “I can lounge all day in this but instead of feeling slummy the way sweatpants make me do because it snatches my body and accentuates all the right curves,” she adds. Plus, Kratky says its quality material, which drapes comfortably on frames without feeling constricting, won’t lose quality with washes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We just hope you’re cool going commando because the dress tends to show whatever you wear underneath — even a nude thong.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4X | <strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Material: </strong>Modal, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bra-skims-fits-everybody-scoop-bralette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bra</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Fits Everybody Scoop Bralette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Fits Everybody Scoop Neck Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OXcKObxplwM91myqWHBi1ybohHo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-fits-everybody-scoop-neck-bra-db5037175c3b44be909961d8ee62a71c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Skims created a bra that supports many cup sizes without feeling uncomfortable or unstylish.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Not everyone found that the bra fits true to size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">More stylish and much sexier than your reliable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sports bra</a>, the Skims scoop neck bra from its Fits Everybody collection does exactly as the name implies.

Even though these will keep you warm when you layer them under clothes during winter (or, if you’re like us, in a frigid office), the high, broad-banded band gives waits a snatched look you’ll want to show off. That said, the material is relatively thin — like the slip dress — so we wouldn’t suggest wearing them to your next pilates class because they’re definitely not squat-proof. But they’ll be great around the house or underneath your clothes as an added layer to keep you warm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4X | <strong>Colors: </strong>9 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shorts-skims-cotton-rib-boxer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shorts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Cotton Rib Boxer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cotton Rib Boxer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eciOBR-UtkuNv_wLra47OcDRLOw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-cotton-rib-boxer-93c17d6d550b47bb9ef9471ee5a95556.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The soft cotton makes these the perfect underwear for lounging and can be styled similarly to bike shorts.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: Tall buyers found they were a little too short to wear out of the house.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Think of these like a comfier version of your favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>biker shorts</a>. Because they’re made with nearly 100 percent soft cotton that’s stretchy enough to avoid any imprints on your skin from a too-tight band, our editors love them for lounging.

Thanks to the seamless design and lightweight fabric, you can feel confident wearing these under leggings and the sheerest of dresses. (Trust us, you’ll barely remember these full-coverage panties are there.) The only time you’ll notice them is when they ride up, which happens occasionally.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4X | <strong>Colors: </strong>14 | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bra-for-small-busts-skims-fits-everybody-triangle-bralette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bra for Small Busts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Fits Everybody Triangle Bralette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Fits Everybody Triangle Bralette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ApeSIOlYpf8T9NW9ra4hWgMsem8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Skims-Fits-Everybody-Triangle-Bralette-4aa82b1577b34f819d5c8c0dae6b3c66.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s one of the few bralettes on the market that offers the same support as those with underwire.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: It’s a little sheer when worn under thinner fabrics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As avid anti-bra advocates, it’s hard to convince us there’s one worth wearing, but this bra makes a case — just ask the InStyle team who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tried the entire collection,</a> Adjustable supportive straps and two-ply supportive mesh give your chest a natural lift, even without lining, providing a similar effect as a push-up bra. Despite having delicate, lightweight straps, people with bigger busts still found the bra provided plenty of support. While an unlined bra is ideal for those who don’t need or want extra padding, it does mean you may show more than desired when wearing this bra under fabrics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4X | <strong>Colors: </strong>15 | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shapewear-skims-seamless-sculpt-brief-bodysuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shapewear</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Seamless Sculpt Brief Bodysuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SKIMS Sculpting Body Suit with Snaps" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WRuoDpTs_mNn2eRhE_8VRmMYgo8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SKIMS-Sculpting-Body-Suit-with-Snaps-031120b7ae6e475b8f42177ff0916118.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Stretchy, soft fabric makes it the perfect shapewear for everyday wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: It takes some effort to pull on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kind of similar to those grow-in-water toys you had as a kid, this bodysuit looks itty bitty at first but transforms into full-sized shapewear when stretched over your body. As a bra-panty-shapewear combo, it’s quite the multi-tasker. The high-cut leg will lift your bum, and the built-in bra supports your chest, all while the body suit gently hugs your midsection for a shape-sculpting finish — perfect under <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a knit dress</a>.

The breathable cotton fabric carries you through warm months, layers seamlessly under sweaters, and keeps you cool during workouts.

Stretchy material lightly compresses your midsection and accentuates your shape. Designed without seams, you won't see any annoying lines when wearing it under tighter outfits. Nothing beats a snap closure for quick trips to the restroom, but we wish Skims could find a way to make the plastic snaps a little more comfortable, especially for those who have a longer torso.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–5X | <strong>Colors: </strong>7 | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pants-skims-cotton-fleece-oversized-cargo-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pants</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Cotton Fleece Oversized Cargo Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Cotton Fleece Oversized Cargo Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7ls9OZRWKQiuXZsKzQZn9ZUrfRs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Skims-Cotton-Fleece-Oversized-Cargo-Pant-ae9bdfcb9ee3413e8894460b9786cec4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The pants serve a classier Kim Possible energy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They run pretty large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s hard to create a cargo pant that doesn’t fit too baggy, but Kim managed to make a figure-enhancing pair. Even if they run a little large, they feature slim side pockets and a heavy-weight fabric that drapes the frame instead of burying them. Plus, as always, it comes in a wide size range, guaranteeing your body will ‘em like a glove. The drawstring waist may seem too casual to take into the office, but you can easily elevate them with platform loafers, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>button-down</a>, and an oversized blazer for a dressed-up look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4X | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-maternity-wear-skims-maternity-sculpting-bodysuit-mid-thigh></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Maternity Wear</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Maternity Sculpting Bodysuit Mid Thigh</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Maternity Sculpting Bodysuit Mid Thigh" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DIJnNxTUx2kptJ0Wd95_PiAEVKM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-maternity-sculpting-bodysuit-mid-thigh-20a4559663084e87bb32dd83aa6d9cad.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The bodysuit adds extra support during pregnancy and smooths for a flattering finish.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Buyers didn’t think the open gusset was very convenient for using the restroom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Kardashians know how to make <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>maternity wear</a> look runway-ready, and while wearing sky-high stilettos while a few months pregnant might not be the most comfortable, Kim created a bodysuit that is. It gently compresses and sculpts your body while supporting your stomach and chest. The body suit does include an open gusset, a must for any one-piece, but some people found it wasn’t large enough and still had to remove the entire bodysuit when using the restroom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–5X | <strong>Colors: </strong>6 | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bodysuit-skims-fits-everybody-square-neck-bodysuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bodysuit</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Square Neck Bodysuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Fits Everybody Square Neck Bodysuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tSPydQtNU_2DARXEqMVqF-ash6A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-fits-everybody-square-neck-bodysuit-b588eb38f7e44fe0be4020c179395c10.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Between the sleeveless design and breathable fabric it’s the basic every wardrobe needs.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Without a bra, it may not support larger chests like it does for smaller ones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Square necks are flattering in their own right (who doesn’t love the illusion of a longer neck?), but this body suit takes it a step further. Kratky says the stretchy material molds around her natural curves for a flattering, non-constricting fit. “Somehow, I can get away without wearing a bra and no one is ever the wiser because its thick material gently compresses and supports my chest.” However, we should note this magical feature may be limited to smaller chest sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XXS–4X |<strong> Colors:</strong> 15 | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-boyshorts-skims-fits-everybody-boyshort></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Boyshorts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Fits Everybody Boyshort</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Fits Everybody Boyshort" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RSoPT-0J-cjL9oJqMwbvXsFmPw0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Skims-Fits-Everybody-Boyshort-4a9cfbbeb55f4374bdbb280dcddfe26a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These provide the full coverage of a boy short while still managing to be sexy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re not seamless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Butan, who is very picky about her underwear, finds that these Skims boyshorts tick off all the boxes she’s looking for. “They're very flattering, comfortable, and stretchy, never riding up or bunching where you don't want them to, and they have just enough cheekiness while still providing full coverage — they're the best of both worlds if you like your underwear a little flirty but still functional,” says Butan. Plus, they're breathable and barely feel like you have anything on. Beyond that, the neutral colors won’t show under lighter fabrics, although we should note that they’re not seamless so we can’t say the same for tighter materials.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4X | <strong>Colors:</strong> 14 | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-petites-skims-soft-lounge-cropped-t-shirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Petites</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Soft Lounge Cropped T-Shirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Soft Lounge Cropped T-Shirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GLYTRHQmzkyJ0VLmFhRKRleL-Uk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Skims-Soft-Lounge-Cropped-T-Shirt-1a680406509c4b36bbf8cee4b9b9071f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The T-shirt hits the exact right spot on our shorter torsos — not too short, not too long.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Sometimes ribbed fabrics can pill.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although Skims doesn’t offer specific sizing for petites, several of its items fit our shorter frames like heaven, and in a way many other basics brands have not yet achieved. “I’m short but have DDs so finding a cropped shirt that isn't too long or too short is a struggle, but the Soft Lounge Cropped T-Shirt is the perfect Goldilocks length,” says InStyle writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tamim Alnuweiri</a>. “The material is sturdy but not too thick, it's a little bit tight and form-fitting but it doesn't highlight every ridge or dip in my skin and body.” We’d say it’s a safe bet for a comfortable everyday T-shirt, and as long as you follow the washing directions, it shouldn’t pill.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4X | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Material: </strong>Modal, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bodysuit-for-tall-frames-skims-essential-crewneck-sleeveless-bodysuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bodysuit for Tall Frames</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Crewneck Bodysuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Crew Neck Bodysuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HOYIgO-Croap07H7_tI1qQmzgRw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Skims-Crew-Neck-Bodysuit-2523e30003a24cd6aa86083fb462a00f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Finally, we found a bodysuit that doesn’t require us to contort our long torsos to fit into it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It runs a little small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle Senior Beauty Editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kaitlin Clark</a> keeps this mock-neck sleeveless bodysuit on heavy outfit rotation, as it stretches across her 5-foot, 9-inch frame without an awkward, uncomfortable pulling on the fabric. The best part, though? It’s extremely versatile — more than you’d think. Clark wears it with everything from jeans, skirts, and jumpsuits to even under a few dresses. “It has a bit of a sheen to it, which I love because it looks a little more elevated than just a regular cotton bodysuit — I pair it with blazers or under sweaters for work, and then on its own for play,” she adds.

We know this is a groundbreaking recommendation but reading the reviews and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">following the size guide</a> is your best friend. Also, keep in mind the magic behind Skims is how the products stretch, so while you may be skeptical when unboxing what looks like a child-sized bodysuit, it’s likely to fit once you try it on. “The only time I size down is when I’m shopping the Cotton Rib Line because I feel like those pieces have a ton of stretch to them,” says Berhanu.</li><li><strong>Collections: </strong>Depending on what collection you shop from is going to determine your best fit. The cotton rib collection, for example, might look similar to the others, but the material is usually thicker, which means it won’t have that same smoothing effect as a piece from, say, the soft lounge collection. Something from this collection will feel more stretchy and you may find yourself sizing down. TikTok and YouTube videos (and our reviews!) are great resources when shopping from Skims.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is Skims?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kim Kardashian, Emma Grede, and Jens Grede co-founded Skims in 2019 intending to make a more inclusive shapewear brand that features an extensive range of sizes and shades.
