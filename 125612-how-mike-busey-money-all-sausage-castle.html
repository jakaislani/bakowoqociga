Like the Playboy Mansion, this Mike Busey's house hosts prolific or wild sex parties. Before social media, the initial sausage parties were promoted by word of mouth.</p><h4><strong>How much is the Sausage Castle membership and does the Sausage Castle still exist?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>The Sausage Castle is primarily online for a $33 monthly membership fee. Members access exclusive content on the website and VIP admission to the house. According to Mike, the real parties are smaller after the Castle burnt down on January 11, 2017, reopening in 2018.</p><h3>Net worth</h3><p class=align-left>Currently, Mike Busey's net worth is approximately $1 million. At one point, he was worth $250. So, how did Mike Busey make all his money? Mike's profits increased when he started using social media to promote his parties by uploading videos to YouTube and MySpace.</p><p class=align-left>The first Sausage Castle back in 2001 accommodated 50,000 visitors. As a result, many club owners approached him to appear as a special guest or promoter.
