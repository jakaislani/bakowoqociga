Beckham recounted asking Peltz to marry him in a gazebo loaded with lights, flowers, champagne, and caviar while appearing on The Late Late Show with James Corden.</p><p>“I couldn’t open the bottle of wine, which was quite humiliating. I eventually opened it after 10 minutes, poured her a glass, and went down on my knees. She had no idea what I was up to. I began telling her how much I adore her. It was just around five minutes long. And then I reach back, grab the ring, open it, and ask, ‘Will you marry me?’ Because I want to spend the rest of my life with you. ‘You’re my best buddy,’ I say.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Brooklyn-Beckham-3.jpg alt="Brooklyn Beckham" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to claim that Peltz cried for the next five minutes as he waited for a response, which he described as “a little nerve-wracking.”&nbsp;Brooklyn and Nicola had planned to marry before 2022, however, their wedding had to be postponed owing to the COVID-19 outbreak.
