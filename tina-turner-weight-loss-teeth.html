The American-born musician seemed to get better and better with age. When many rockstars were looking to slow down, the stunning musician always thought age was irrelevant.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with Mirror in 2009, she said, “A 50-year-old woman is equivalent to a 40-year-old woman when I was growing up.” “If you take care of yourself, sixty is nothing these days for women.” You can be the lady you want to be in today’s world,” the late musician added.</p><p>Tina’s upbeat positivity does not imply that she hadn’t witnessed the change over the last 25 years; she was just able to put things into perspective.</p><p>Tina’s body weight had stayed relatively steady, at roughly eight and a half stone, although she noticed some wrinkles on her face.</p><p>Furthermore, Tina attributed her steady weight to avoiding eating after 6 pm, drinking plenty of water, and dancing.

The singer later revealed that it was the first time when Ike instilled fear within her.</p><p>The Better Be Good To Me singer decided to stay with him as she loved her. Following the birth of her son, Ronnie, in October 1960, the couple moved to Los Angeles in 1962 and married in Tijuana.</p><p>Turner eventually went suicidal as a result of the circumstances. She described how the horrifying assault prompted a suicide attempt in which she ingested numerous sleeping pills in her book My Love Story.</p><p>“He damaged my jaw, and I couldn’t recall what it was like not to be without black eye,” she wrote of her suffering via Independent.</p><p>Tina took the brave, life-altering decision to leave in 1976.
