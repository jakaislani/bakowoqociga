What, if any, personal experience are you bringing to this film?</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ian and I grew up playing basketball, soccer, and baseball so we brought a lot of our own experiences from those years. Less specific moments or characters, but lots of little details. I spent a lot of time in gyms as a player, a fan, and even a ref for a little bit. Our dad coached us growing up so we had a lot of different angles on the world even within our own family.&nbsp;</p><p>Youth sports are endlessly fascinating to us. All of the narratives that people bring into this space that’s both communal and competitive. There are so many stories happening simultaneously in whatever direction you look. It can be very high stakes or incredibly dull depending on your connection to what’s happening, and I find that combination of energies really compelling.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a specific type of mania that inflicts some parents when it comes to their kid’s athletic careers. Emotions dominate while logic and context go out the window—a great place to be for a dramatic story.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I feel like a lot of people in education can relate to this. Have you heard reactions from anyone who might be in this kind of situation?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>No one in teaching specifically, but I can definitely see how some of these experiences would apply. We’ve heard from a lot of people who are involved in youth sports as coaches, parents, refs, players, etc. ...&nbsp;It’s been very fun and a little terrifying hearing other people’s stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/63162cd4b8b50d37dd7d2cc2/content_Ref_BTS__22_of_22_.jpg><p><strong>Shooting it in 4:3 (correct me if I’m technically wrong on that) is an interesting choice.
