For lack of a better word, Harrison gets the “flashy” performance, but he’s not the only stand-out here, in fact it’s Taylor Russell who feels like the revelation. Few young actresses have been able to convey so much emotion with a worried look or warm embrace. She only has a few scenes before she’s asked to carry some heavy emotional weight, but she carries it gracefully and movingly. And Brown has a couple scenes that reveal the depth of character he’s found here as well. Like a lot of great dramas, you can see the backstory work done by the actors. Brown isn’t just showing up and delivering lines, he’s playing a fully-realized, complete character. And so when these people are pushed into emotional situations, we feel their pain because of the detailed background&nbsp;they imbued into their characters.</p><p>“Waves” is visually daring in ways that will make it perfect for year-end montages about&nbsp;the best films of 2019, but what stuns me most is how much Shults, even at just 30, has found a way to balance the lyrical and the human. Some will compare it to <a href=#>Barry Jenkins</a>’ work—and the Florida setting adds to that—but Shults has his own voice. It’s one that carefully considers all technical decisions – the sound design here is fantastic&nbsp;too—but then grounds it all in character. He finds a way to marry his technical playfulness to the performances he pulls from his award-worthy cast.</p><p>When we’re 18, we think we’re invincible, especially in the case of&nbsp;star athletes—Tyler literally shouts “I cannot be taken down” with his teammates before a wrestling match. Yes, Tyler, you can. And not everyone has the emotional strength to handle when life takes them down, or to cope&nbsp;when they make horrible mistakes, and Shults’ film is careful to reveal how that can happen at any age, whether it’s Tyler’s life-changing decisions or the well-meaning but deeply damaging pressure from his father, which is also a mistake. We all make them. But even those mistakes can lead to grace, forgiveness, and&nbsp;beauty. They can lead to&nbsp;a recognition that the wave that crashes on the beach will soon recede back to the peace of the ocean.&nbsp;</p><p>This review was filed from the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wmK%2Bdo2K6sMLInmSrnaaesrh5kWlocg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
