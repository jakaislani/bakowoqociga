The only satisfying sequence is a close-quarters fight near the end&nbsp;that goes on and on&nbsp;until it becomes horrific, then exhausting, then&nbsp;funny. "I'm a bit rusty," one combatant admits, blood streaming from his face.&nbsp;</p><p>But on the other hand—and here's where "Ava"&nbsp;will lose viewers looking for the usual—the film's heart belongs to its&nbsp;non-action scenes: simply staged&nbsp;face-offs&nbsp;between Chastain's Ava, a&nbsp;recovering alcoholic and former teenaged delinquent,&nbsp;and supporting characters played&nbsp;by <a href=#>Geena Davis</a>, Common, Joan&nbsp;Chen, <a href=#>Jess Weixler</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>John Malkovich</a>, and other performers skilled enough to &nbsp;make words sting like&nbsp;slaps. (<a href=#>Ioan Gruffudd</a>, a handsome actor who's&nbsp;often cast as the&nbsp;slightly dull&nbsp;heroic lead,&nbsp;even shows up for&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;scenes as a scuzzbag&nbsp;money-mover, and seems to relish being&nbsp;free of the burden of nobility.)&nbsp;</p><p>The movie starts by establishing Ava as a talented but unstable "executive."&nbsp;She's adored by her&nbsp;grizzled&nbsp;mentor Duke (John Malkovich), a self-described father figure who replaced the bad biological dad who died when Ava was still a drunk.&nbsp;But she's marked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem employee, thanks to her habit of getting her targets where she wants them, then pushing them to confess a bad thing they've done before "closing" them.&nbsp;It's evidence of a latent moral streak that's&nbsp;bubbling up in Ava&nbsp;after years of being tactically suppressed—and it's&nbsp;bad for&nbsp;business. Another of Duke's trainees, Simon (<a href=#>Colin Farrell</a>, playing a murderous family man with a&nbsp;pornstar mustache and&nbsp;side-walled pompadour), is a rising star who's being&nbsp;groomed as Duke's replacement. He&nbsp;warns Duke that Ava has&nbsp;screwed up too oftenand is&nbsp;on deck to get "closed" by another "executive." Duke can't cover&nbsp;for Ava forever. Her&nbsp;bill will&nbsp;come due. Can Duke save her?</p><p>"Ava"&nbsp;never completely loses interest in its spy-world plot, but it becomes increasingly obvious that the&nbsp;actors and filmmakers are more invested in scenes where the characters talk to each other, poring over personal business and picking at emotional scabs. As I sit here writing this review, I'm having a hard time remembering any of the action scenes except for that last fight. But I&nbsp;have a photographic recall of scenes where Ava&nbsp;visits her ill&nbsp;mother Bobbi (Davis) in the hospital&nbsp;and reconnects with her estranged sister Judy (Wexler)&nbsp;and her husband Michael (Common).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46arZplnaTDqrGMq5yvoZWsenN8kWk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
