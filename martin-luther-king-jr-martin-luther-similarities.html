Inspired by the life and deeds of the 16th-century monk, King changed both his name and that of his young son, who became known to the world as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thus marked the first and clearest connection between the two famed men.

He eventually determined that there was no need for a controlling and corruptible Church hierarchy; one could achieve salvation simply <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/reformation/martin-luther-and-the-95-theses data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="by putting their faith in Christ" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">by putting their faith in Christ</a> and looking to Scripture as the central religious authority.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King's anger wasn't geared toward the Church, but at a system of racial segregation that had become ensconced in everyday life and law since Reconstruction, one acutely felt by a highly intelligent and able African-American boy raised in the Jim Crow South.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Both arrived at just the right time</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The seeds of Reformation were planted well before Luther first opened a Bible, as dissenters like 14th-century English theologian and academic John Wyclif (also spelled Wycliffe, among other variations) had previously spoken out against the Church's abuse of power. However, Luther benefited from the relatively recent invention of the printing press, which allowed his ideas to quickly spread across Europe.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Similarly, efforts to organize and empower African Americans had been around since before King was born, but the courageous stand of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/rosa-parks data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rosa Parks" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rosa Parks</a> presented a ripe opportunity for King to enter the limelight with the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/montgomery-bus-boycott data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Montgomery Bus Boycott" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a> and assume leadership of the burgeoning civil rights movement.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">They risked their lives by defying authorities</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The story of Luther dramatically nailing his <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/reformation/martin-luther-and-the-95-theses data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="95 Theses" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">95 Theses</a> to the door of the Wittenberg Castle Church to demand change may not be true, but the widespread distribution of the document had the same effect. He was excommunicated by Pope Leo X in early 1521 and staunchly defended his beliefs before a hostile audience at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/luther-defiant-at-diet-of-worms data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diet of Worms" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Diet of Worms</a> a few months later, the charges of heresy carrying the genuine threat of a death sentence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King's method of civil disobedience, meanwhile, made him a prime target of both the police and violent extremists. He was arrested nearly 30 times during his dozen-plus years in the public eye and survived an assassination attempt a decade before the one that took his life April 4, 1968.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">They were acclaimed for their writing and communication skills</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with his 95 Theses, Luther penned both the Small and Large Catechisms as the foundation for the new Christian denomination, Protestantism, and helped make the Bible a household item by translating the Old and New Testaments into German. By the time of his death in 1546, he was the author of a third of all German-language books in publication.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King also produced a large trove of written works, including the book Why We Can't Wait and his seminal "Letter from a Birmingham Jail."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Extending those lines of communication, both men were acclaimed for their oratorical skills. King is more famous in this arena, thanks to surviving footage of his powerful speeches, but Luther also developed a reputation as a compelling lecturer at the University of Wittenberg.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Luther and King's movements moved on without them</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Luther's calls for freedom from the rigid doctrines of the Church unsurprisingly took on a life of their own. Within a few years of the release of 95 Theses, both the German nobility and peasantry co-opted his message to justify their rebellions. And while he codified his beliefs in the formation of what became Protestantism, reform continued through the acts of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/henry-viii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="King Henry VIII" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">King Henry VIII</a> and other British monarchs, as well as the teachings of religious leaders like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/religious-figures/john-calvin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Calvin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Calvin</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King, meanwhile, found his non-violent methods falling out of favor during the turbulent 1960s, with an increasingly fractured and impatient base turning to the more radical voices of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/malcolm-x data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Malcolm X" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Malcolm X</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/huey-p-newton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Huey Newton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Huey Newton</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/stokely-carmichael data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stokely Carmichael" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stokely Carmichael</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Luther and King later faced controversies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Whether overwhelmed by ailments or emboldened by years of escaping the wrath of authorities, Luther threw all restraint to the wind over his final decade. His 1543 work On the Jews and Their Lies summed up his feelings about that group, though he also had harsh words for the Pope, "godless monks" and other members of the clergy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King's case is more nuanced. While he never succumbed to age-inflicted bitterness — in part because he was killed before turning 40 — he did pivot to causes that failed to strike a unifying chord, including an anti-Vietnam War crusade and a "Poor People's Campaign" for economic change. Toward the end of his life, a major poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans held an unfavorable opinion of the civil rights icon.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">They changed the future of religion and civil rights</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By standing up to the Catholic Church, Luther is credited with sparking the Reformation and opening the door to a modern world built on concepts of individuality, religious liberty and self- government. Approximately one-eighth of the seven and a half billion people worldwide today, more than 900 million people, follow the religion he founded. And one of the major branches of Protestantism is named after Luther: Lutheranism.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King's call to duty also brought tangible changes, from the 1956 Supreme Court ruling that ended segregation on city buses to the Civil Rights and Voting Acts of 1964 and '65. Arguably the most <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr-call-to-activism data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="important figure" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">important figure</a> from the American civil right movement, he is one of the few non-U.S. presidents to be awarded a monument at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and the only one to be honored with a national holiday.</p><h5 class="css-1l2lp8z e5xkl6w6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Martin Luther King's Most Inspirational Quotes<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1_martin-luther-king-jr-delivers-a-speech-to-a-crowd-of-approximately-7000-people-on-may-17-1967-at-uc-berkeleys-sproul-plaza-in-berkeley-california-photo-by-michael-ochs-archivesgetty-images.jpg alt="martin luther king jr delivers a speech on may 17 1967 at uc berkeleys sproul plaza in berkeley california" title="Martin Luther King, Jr. delivers a speech to a crowd of approximately 7,000 people on May 17, 1967 at UC Berkeley's Sproul Plaza in Berkeley, California" width=3015 height=1980 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-1wy1tq4 e5xkl6w1">1_Martin Luther King, Jr. delivers a speech to a crowd of approximately 7,000 people on May 17, 1967 at UC Berkeley's Sproul Plaza in Berkeley, California.
