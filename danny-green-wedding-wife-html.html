Lakers star wished his lady a happy sixth anniversary. He wrote,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Happy 6 years babe! the real thing starts soon! Can’t wait until the Day! Love you forever and always</p><p>Of course, the first and last few words were not surprising at all for anyone who was even vaguely familiar with Green's love life.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the Lakers star said that the real thing would start soon. It was most definitely a teaser, telling fans that their nuptials were right around the corner.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Fianc<strong>é</strong>e Posted Too</h2><p>The beautiful&nbsp;Bashen also put up a post on her socials on the same day. Her post&nbsp;featured a series of heartwarming snaps of the adorable couple.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Although the snaps she shared were not as dramatic, it was still plenty romantic, with the casually dressed couple holding one another in ample sunshine.&nbsp;</p><p>In her captions too, after wishing her beau on their anniversary, she explicitly&nbsp;announced that this was going to be their last anniversary before their marriage.</p><h2>Green Proposed on Their Fifth Anniversary</h2><p>Green proposed to Bashen in June 2020, getting on one knee at Surfer's Point Beach in Ventura. In fact, he'd popped the question on their fifth anniversary.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Shortly after, he let his fans relive his special moment as he put the photos up on Instagram for all to see.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Much like the recent anniversary, the couple also celebrated their fifth year of togetherness on a beach.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the caption, Green apologized for taking so long to pop the question. Apparently, he wanted to get her the ring she deserved but had to save up for it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>It is noteworthy that the professional basketball player had&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made</a> upwards of 67 million dollars at that point in his career. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Also, he had signed a 30 million dollar contract with the L.A. Lakers the year prior.</p><p>So either that is a joke, or that was one expensive ring. The former seems more likely.&nbsp;</p><p>In a nutshell, it is all but confirmed that the next anniversary&nbsp;Green and Bashen celebrate would be as husband and wife.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Going by the NBA star's Instagram wishes, it is likely that the two will become husband and wife sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnlJa7r8WMoKmenZ5ixKaww6KloGWnnrOmesetpKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
