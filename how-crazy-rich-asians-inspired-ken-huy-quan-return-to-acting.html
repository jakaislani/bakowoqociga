They’ve said his example helped inspire them to pursue careers in Hollywood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Quan, 51, says he’s the one who should be thanking them. Frustrated by the lack of opportunities for Asian performers, Quan abandoned acting more than two decades ago. He was lured back due to positive changes in Asian representation in movies and television in recent years, especially in the 2018 film Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“They always thank me and say, ‘Man, it was so great to see you up there on the screen, because I was able to see myself.

My return to acting is the direct result of the progress made by them. It proves how important it is for not just Asian, but for all groups of people to be represented in entertainment.”</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Leaving Acting Behind</h2><img alt="harrison ford, ke huy quan, and kate capshaw on the movie set for indiana jones and the temple of doom, walking past a stone building and several women dressed in brown clothes" title="Harrison Ford And Kate Capshaw In 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom'" width=1024 height=658 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/harrison-ford-jonathan-ke-quan-and-kate-capshaw-are-lead-news-photo-1678218777.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>A young Ke Huy Quan on the set of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) with Harrison Ford and Kate Capshaw.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Vietnam-born Quan portrayed beloved characters as Indiana Jones’ sidekick Short Round and the precocious <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/a26267305/goonies-cast-where-are-they-now/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Data in The Goonies" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Data in The Goonies</a>.

Content with this new direction in his career, Quan thought his acting days were long behind him. But that all changed when he watched Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Directed by Jon M.

He saw it as the type of positive Asian representation that had been lacking during his early career, and it made him want to get back in front of the camera.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“For a long time I thought I was at peace with [retiring from acting], but something was missing, and I really didn’t know what it was until Crazy Rich Asians came out,” Quan told GQ. “I saw my fellow Asian actors up on the screen, and I had serious FOMO because I wanted to be up there with them.”</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Reclaiming His Dream Career</h2><img alt="michelle yeoh, ke huy quan, stephanie hsu, jamie lee curtis, and james hong hold green trophies and cheer while posing for a photo" title="TOPSHOT-US-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-AWARD-SAG-PRESS ROOM" width=6032 height=4188 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actors-michelle-yeoh-ke-huy-quan-stephanie-hsu-jamie-lee-news-photo-1678219139.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Ke Huy Quan and the cast of Everything Everywhere All at Once pose with their awards for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture during the 29th Screen Actors Guild Awards on February 26, 2023.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A newly-inspired Quan reached out to an agent friend to see if he’d like to represent him.
