The idea that we are trying to escape from the ghetto of Black culture is insulting.</li><li>I once wrote a short story called 'The Best Blues Singer in the World' and it went like this: 'The streets that Balboa walked were his own private ocean, and Balboa was drowning.' End of story. That says it all. Nothing else to say. I've been rewriting that same story over and over again. All my plays are rewriting that same story. I'm not sure what it means, other than life is hard.</li><li>I think my plays offer (white Americans) a different way to look at Black Americans. For instance, in 'Fences' they see a garbageman, a person they don't really look at, although they see a garbageman every day. By looking at Troy's life, white people find out that the content of this Black garbageman's life is affected by the same things—love, honor, beauty, betrayal, duty. Recognizing that these things are as much part of his life as theirs can affect how they think about and deal with Black people in their lives.</li></ul><span class="css-1s9owpq e17dn9hs1"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/b50d4909-0f39-4b73-b482-46d0a9078d40_1682363012.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Biography.com Editors" title="Headshot of Biography.com Editors" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>The Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.
