It’s Wisconsin’s own LaCroix, first launched in 1981. And it comes in many, many flavors. But for this GMM taste test, Rhett & Link stuck to the single-flavor La Croix varieties. They donned their dual-action LaCroix tasting device and sucked down ten flavors, scoring them on a one-to-ten scale. Here’s how the ranking fizzed out.

He gave it a 1, while Link simply commented that it was “lotiony” and gave it a flat 0.</p><strong>Pure</strong><p>The plain sparkling water did not impress. “It’s effervescent nothing,” said Link. He gave it a 1. Rhett liked it but noted you can get “non-flavored water in so many places,” and gave it a 4.&nbsp;</p><strong>Passionfruit</strong><p>“It tastes like fruit made in a lab—made by a doctor,” said Rhett. “A good doctor,” Link countered. Rhett gave it a 3 and Link, good doctor comment aside, gave it a 4.</p><strong>Lemon</strong><p>Both Rhett & Link agreed that citrus flavors do particularly well in sparkling water. They liked this one (Rhett gave it a 5 and Link gave it a 3), but not as much as some of the other citrus flavors. “It has a cleaner-esque taste to it,” Link said.</p><strong>Mango</strong><p>“I like a dry mango but do I like a wet mango?” Link pondered. He gave it an above average score of 5.5. Rhett was not as sold on it. “I just taste baby food that’s a week old,” he said, and gave it a 3.</p><strong>Apricot</strong><p>The boys were split on this one. “It has a fakey taste to it,” said Rhett. He gave it a 3.5. “I don’t taste the fakeness as much,” Link said and gave it a 5.75.</p><strong><strong>Pamplemousse</strong></strong><p>Link admitted to not liking grapefruit but he still gave this one a 5. Rhett was much more of a fan and gave the water that taught Americans the French word for grapefruit a 7.1.</p><strong>Berry</strong><p>“What kind of berry is it?” asked Rhett. “I don’t care, I like it,” said Link. He gave it a 6 while Rhett gave it a 7.</p><strong>Orange</strong><p>“It has the sweetness of the orange with the refreshingness of the lime,” Rhett said. He gave it an 8.1 (his top score), while Link gave it a 7.</p><strong>Lime</strong><p>“I’m a big fan of this one,” said Rhett. “This is a flavor that was meant to be added to a sparkling water.” Both he and Link gave it an 8.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Ultimate LaCroix Taste Test" title='Play video "Ultimate LaCroix Taste Test"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dDjjS_5knk&list=PLJ49NV73ttrsUefw67wH_pnEJ5KwJZ7lN&index=543</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKqYmsG1ecuipaRll6K6brjAZpqrp5mtfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
