This summons memories of their first date—envision a rental boat on a park lake, inept male rowing and a thoughtful picnic—and is one of several flashbacks interspersed among present-day occurrences. When she actually runs into Ben (<a href=#>Noah Baumbach</a> regular <a href=#>Matthew Shear</a>, who comes off like a less-caustic and introverted <a href=#>Seth Rogen</a>) the next morning as she is moving in, he is averse to a get-together, friendly or otherwise. Matters grow more uneasy when she realizes that he and the dreadful Meg live together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Brooks tries to keep matters interesting with visually arresting backdrops for both present-day events and those set in the past. There is the boutique where Diana waits on demanding brides-to-be and their mothers, a rooftop Halloween costume party with Gabby donning a Marie Antoinette costume and Diana as possibly Alexander Hamilton, the opening of a friend’s ’70s throwback art installation and a meeting with Diana and her editor at Jack’s Wife Freda, a cool West Village bistro.</p><p>Three notable encounters perhaps most affect what eventually happens to Diana and Ben, who obviously care for each other and seem a perfect match. But they are never quite in sync. In the present-day, a reunion of sorts happens when they both attend Amy’s play—and Ben lets it slip that Meg has moved out. They end up at a restaurant afterwards, laughing at the Kafka-esque fact that lemon risotto is on the menu but the stuffy Italian waiter refuses them any lemons for their water. But the flirty mood gives Ben false hope that the evening will end in romance, which Diana isn’t ready for.</p><p>The crux of their problem, though, can be found in two flashbacks: First, there is Ben’s reply when, while snuggling in bed during a power outage, Diana asks him describe his vision for life. “I want what my parents have. Decades together and still being in love.” Later, we and Diana get to meet this long-wed twosome while visiting his folks for Hanukkah. When his dad declares with a wink, “We still know how to schmear each other's bagels,” you can see Diana’s upbeat mood slowly deflate. Add to that the bittersweet scene where she tells Ben that his assumption that he can visit her when she is in London isn’t going to happen, what with visa issues and such. Clearly, she wants to be free.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The story is far from over, however, after an unexpected medical-related crisis pushes them back together. It might feel like a cop-out for Brooks to leave the status of Diana and Ben open-ended. But she sprinkles enough clues along the way to allow the audience to come to their own satisfying conclusion. Any movie that can bring to mind a <a href=#>Joni Mitchell</a> song as the credits roll—“Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone”—has earned its keep.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lkqTGbrDOsKWsrJGev7R5kWlocQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
