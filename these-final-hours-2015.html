In Perth, Australia, the approaching firestorm is set to arrive in about 12&nbsp;</span><span>hours and the mood of the remaining populace veers between grim resignation (with&nbsp;</span><span>suicides aplenty) and a determination to make Earth's remaining moments play out&nbsp;</span><span>like a mash-up of "The Road Warrior" and "<a href=#>The Purge</a>." Our anti-hero, James (Nathan&nbsp;</span><span>Phillips), is leaning more towards the latter and after a farewell snog with girlfriend Zoe&nbsp;</span><span>(Jessica de Gouw), he decides to leave her alone so that he can spend the rest of&nbsp;</span><span>his time at a wild bacchanal thrown by friend Freddy (<a href=#>Daniel Henshall</a>) with his other&nbsp;</span><span>girlfriend, Vicky (<a href=#>Kathryn Beck</a>) and not even her revelations that she is pregnant can&nbsp;</span><span>convince him to stay. He wants to get messed up because, as he puts it, "I don't want to&nbsp;</span><span>feel a thing."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>James heads off to the party that he has placed above everything else, and&nbsp;</span><span>after getting waylaid along the way, he sees a little girl who has been abducted by a couple of&nbsp;</span><span>depraved weirdos for presumably unspeakable reasons. D</span><span>espite his insistence&nbsp;</span><span>that he no longer cares about anything, he rescues the girl, Rose (<a href=#>Angourie Rice</a>), and&nbsp;</span><span>when he is unable to reunite her with her father, he decides to take her along to the&nbsp;</span><span>party in the hopes of finding someone there who can take her to be reunited with her&nbsp;</span><span>family. Needless to say, as they go along their trek, the two bear witness to any number&nbsp;</span><span>of horrible sights but Rose's optimism and innocence in the face of the oncoming&nbsp;</span><span>apocalypse (Spoiler Alert!) begins to change his cynical soul. Once they arrive at the&nbsp;</span><span>party—an orgy of open sex, prodigious drug and alcohol abuse and bouts of Russian&nbsp;</span><span>Roulette—he discovers that nihilism may no longer be his thing and tries to get Rose&nbsp;</span><span>back together with her family and settle his own outstanding emotional debts before it is&nbsp;</span><span>really too late.</span></p><p>Written and directed by <a href=#>Zak Hilditch</a>, "These Final Hours" is more ambitious than its&nbsp;<span>presumably inexpensive origins might suggest but this is the kind of storyline that has&nbsp;</span><span>been done dozens of times before and even the better parts of this effort contain more&nbsp;</span><span>than a whiff of the familiar. The finale, for example, is presented in a relatively striking&nbsp;</span><span>manner but anyone who has seen the vastly superior apocalyptic drama "<a href=#>Take Shelter</a>"&nbsp;</span><span>will no doubt notice a number of similarities between the two climaxes. Likewise,&nbsp;</span><span>the relationship between Phillips (whose presence here, following on the heels of&nbsp;</span><span>appearances in such films as "<a href=#>Wolf Creek</a>," "Snake on a Plane" and "The Chernobyl&nbsp;</span><span>Diaries," marks him as one of the guys you least want to have with you on a cinematic&nbsp;</span><span>excursion of any duration) and Rice doesn't really hit any overtly wrong notes but&nbsp;</span><span>nevertheless fails to break any new ground either. Even the end-of-the-world blowout&nbsp;</span><span>is nowhere as decadent as one might hope—from what we see, it basically feels like&nbsp;</span><span>Burning Man sans the morning-after hangovers—and when it does threaten to become&nbsp;</span><span>transgressive, as when little Rose is dosed with Ecstasy and begins tripping, it pulls&nbsp;</span><span>back the reins before things can get too weird.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn56rlWKzqrrApWShp6WnwG5%2Bj2ps</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
