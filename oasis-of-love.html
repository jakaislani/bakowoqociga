The lyrics describe the singer's journey from a dry and parched land to the oasis of love, where the pastures are green all year round. The singer attributes his transformation to the words of a song from a small Jesus band, which turned his life around.</p><br><p>The Oasis of Love is a place where the hungry are fed, the lonely are given companionship, and those in need are given a home. The singer acknowledges that this place may not be everyone's ideal, but it's all that he needed and it's real. The singer encourages others who are lost in the desert of life to come and drink from the cup of friendship and love that he has found.</p><br><p>The song is a simple but powerful message of hope and transformation. It speaks to people who are lost and alone, offering them a way out of their despair. The message is one of love and acceptance, and the singer is inviting others to join him in the oasis of love. The song is a testament to the transformative power of love and community, and it reminds us that we all need a place of refuge and hope in our lives.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I came to this place, from a dry thirsty land</u><br>I arrived at this location, coming from an arid and parched land</p><br><p><u>A drifter at heart, with no definite plans</u><br>I am someone who wanders aimlessly, lacking a clear direction or purpose</p><br><p><u>But words of a song, from a small Jesus band</u><br>However, the lyrics of a tune performed by a small group of Christian believers had a profound impact on me</p><br><p><u>Turned one wasted life all around</u><br>Those words transformed a life that was previously empty and devoid of meaning</p><br><p><u>There's food for the hungry, joy for the sad</u><br>Here, those who are hungry can find sustenance, and those who are feeling down can discover happiness</p><br><p><u>A home for the homeless, kids moms and dads</u><br>This is a welcoming place for those without a place to live or raise their family</p><br><p><u>It may not appear your exacting ideal</u><br>It might not meet all of your stringent requirements for what you consider perfect</p><br><p><u>But it's all that I needed it's for real</u><br>Yet, it was exactly what I required, and it is truly genuine and authentic</p><br><p><u>I sing to my King, praise and thank Him again</u><br>I express my admiration and gratitude to God, singing once more in adoration</p><br><p><u>Because of His love, a loser can win</u><br>Thanks to the love that God has shown, someone who was previously considered a failure can now be a success</p><br><p><u>Hey you on the desert of life, come on in</u><br>To those of you who are experiencing a dry and barren existence, I invite you to partake of the blessings found here</p><br><p><u>And drink from the cup of a friend</u><br>And refresh yourself by accepting the hospitality and companionship that this community offers</p><br><p><u>I found an oasis of love</u><br>I discovered a place filled with love and acceptance</p><br><p><u>The pastures are green year round</u><br>Here, there is always a sense of nourishment and vitality</p><br><p><u>A new life is mine, with peace from above</u><br>As a result of my time spent in this place, my life has been renewed, and I enjoy a serenity that can only come from God</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Writer(s): David Ingles</span></p><p>Contributed by Lily R.
