While Megan Fox may have started the movement — with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sydney Sweeney</a> not too far behind — they say three's a trend and Kim Kardashian (aka the trendsetter herself) just stepped with her platinum blonde tresses parted inches off center.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Saturday night, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kardashian</a> arrived solo at the This Is About Humanity 4th Annual Fundraiser in Los Angeles looking as chic as ever in a sheer black Balenciaga maxi dress that featured long sleeves and a turtleneck design. While Kim's waist-skimming hair certainly served as a focal point for the ensemble, which she accessorized with Balenciaga wrap-around sunglasses and a black clutch, the SKIMS founder called on yet another mid-2010s trend to complete the look: neon green booties as a pop of color. Similar to her outfit, Kim's glam was equally as low-key and consisted of a bronzy makeup look, a nude lip, and a pastel pink manicure.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kim's dateless appearance comes just weeks after she called it quits with her boyfriend of nine months, Pete Davidson, at the beginning of August. While Kardashian seems to be doing better than ever following their split (well, if sexy Instagram photo dumps are any indication), we now finally have some insight as to how Davidson is feeling, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to a source talking to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Us Weekly</a>, the comedian is ready to move on and put this chapter in the past. "Pete is focusing on himself and his career right now and trying to make himself happy," the source shared. "He's got a huge career ahead of him and has a ton of irons in the fire post-SNL. He has a hugely ambitious streak. Pete wants to continue his standup comedy routine, and challenge himself with new acting roles. He enjoyed the experience in Australia a lot, really bonded with the cast and crew and is excited about the future."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qipGajkaexor%2FHopinZaeawLV7yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlpKq%2FtbjEp5yco12Zv6a%2F0maeq52Vo3qju86tqmarmZmybrzAq6s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
