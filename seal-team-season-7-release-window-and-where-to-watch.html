Boreanaz plays Jason Hayes, the leader of a Navy SEAL team, dealing with the devastating death of one of their teammates.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>The united includes Ray Perry (Neil Brown Jr.), Sonny Quinn (AJ Buckley), and Clay Spenser<a href=#> (Max Thieriot)</a>. Lieutenant Commander Eric Blackburn is played by Judd Lormand and CIA analyst Mandy Ellis is played by Jessica Paré, most recognizable for her role as Megan Calvet on Mad Men.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>With a cast this stacked, it’s no wonder the show has been a hit with audiences, making its upcoming season 7 a highly-anticipated drop. Unfortunately, fans might have to wait a while for the show to return.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-in-season-6 data-injectable=false>What happened in season 6?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>The sixth season of the show, which also streamed on Paramount Plus, consisted of 10 episodes and premiered on Sept. 18, 2022, running until Nov. 20 of that year. Throughout the season, the team was deployed on several high-tension, high-stakes missions across the globe, from Russian-controlled territory to Northern Syria to Amman, Jordan.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Both Boreanaz and Paré turned into directors this season, with each tackling behind-the-camera duties in addition to starring onscreen. Paré directed the season’s second episode, titled “Crawl, Walk, Run,” and Boreanaz directed episode four of the season, called “Phantom Pattern.”</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Thieriot appeared on season 6, but this concluded his time on the show, as he also stars in the ongoing series Fire Country. His last episode was in season 6 during episode 8, which was titled, “Aces and Eights.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When will season 7 be released?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>The show was renewed for a seventh season back in January 2023, but a wrench was thrown into plans for production when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Writers Guild of America strike</a> began. Things got even dicier when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Screen Actors Guild also ordered a strike</a>. The dual strikes have slowed down or halted production across Hollywood, and SEAL Team has certainly been affected.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>No release date has been set as of yet for the new season of the show, so it would be reasonable to expect that it won’t arrive until deep into 2024 considering it hasn’t even started shooting. Fans were hopeful that it would premiere in fall 2023, but unfortunately, it has yet to reach anyone’s screen. When the new season does debut, fans can tune in on CBS to watch it live, or catch it streaming directly on Paramount Plus.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, the writers’ strike and actors’ strike have both concluded, which means that filming for the seventh season can officially begin. Until it is released, fans can enjoy watching the re-airing of season 6 on CBS. The other seasons of the show are also available to stream on Paramount Plus at any time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0scClZK2dkaJ6tLHArKanZWdiv6a4xJqqnmWnnrulu9ZmmKecXay1pr7EZquoZaeWwaS0jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
