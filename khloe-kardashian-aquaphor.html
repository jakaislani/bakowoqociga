A lot of the A-listers’ ride-or-die products are well out of my price range, but it’s still fun to uncover their beauty secrets. When I watched </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span><a href=# id=auto-tag_khloe-kardashian data-tag=khloe-kardashian>Khloe Kardashian</a>’s ‘Hot Ones’ interview</span></a><span>, I thought this was the last place I’d hear her chat about her skincare must-haves. However, like all of Sean Evans’ star-studded, hot wing-centric conversations, I learned something new and surprising.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shaperx-bodysuit-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/patrick-mahomes-kansas-city-chiefs.png><p><span>Sean asked Khloe for skincare hacks that a beginner like him could try. She replied, “I wear </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span><a href=# id=auto-tag_aquaphor data-tag=aquaphor>Aquaphor</a></span></a><span> [or] Vaseline around my eyes every night. I think it helps with wrinkles and all that. That’s really inexpensive and easy.”</span></p><p><span>This isn’t the first time she has vouched for the product. Back in </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>2016</span></a><span>, she shared on her app that she applies </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Aquaphor</span></a><span> on her eyes, so clearly, this is a tried-and-true essential.</span></p><p><span>You’d expect the upper echelon of Hollywood to use only high-end beauty products, but it turns out this is not always the case. </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Aquaphor’s Healing Ointment</span></a><span> lines the shelves of all your local drugstores and is incredibly affordable, sitting at just $14 for a 14-ounce tube.</span></p><p><span>The </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>multi-tasking product</span></a><span> is capable of restoring your dry, compromised skin to a healthier state. It’s also multifunctional in that you can apply it pretty much anywhere your skin is craving moisture. Lips, face, body, minor cuts, heels, cuticles, hands—hardly anywhere is off limits with this formula.</span></p><p><span>Khloe has been using the </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Healing Ointment</span></a><span> for years, which is quite a feat considering she’s constantly trying a ton of beauty products. This Aquaphor one has stood the test of time in her skincare cabinet and we predict it’ll do the same for you, too.</span></p><p><b>RELATED: </b><a href=# rel=noopener><b>This Kim Kardashian-Approved Self-Tanner Is 44% Off During Nordstrom’s Anniversary Sale</b></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aquaphor-healing-ointment-amazon.jpeg><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Aquaphor Healing Ointment</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$13.74 (was $14.99)</span></p><p><span>The </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Healing Ointment’s</span></a><span> formula is short, sweet and no-frills, so it’s ideal for those who prefer simple products.

It differs from a lotion or cream in that it’s water-free and forms a protective barrier that lets oxygen flow through and heal areas of concern.

The </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Aquaphor Healing Ointment</span></a><span>, however, is an exception that’ll make your skin smooth and healthy in a snap.
