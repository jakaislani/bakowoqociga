However, their marriage didn't last long, as the couple got a divorce in 1999. While not much has been disclosed publicly about their relationship, Quinlan alluded to Sizemore's abuse and a troubling divorce, per a 2019 piece in <a href=#>The Eden Magazine.</a> It's worth noting that Sizemore has been Quinlan's only husband. While she didn't repeat his name, Quinlan opened up about her distressing experiences as a wife. She revealed, "I am finally ready to say this and make it public, that I am a survivor of domestic abuse, and that's something I intend to bring awareness to in my fifties. I didn't like to talk about it earlier because I was just grateful to be out of that marriage and out of harm's way."</p><p dir=ltr>Following his marriage to Quinlan, Sizemore developed a reputation for being sexually and physically abusive. In 2003, he was found guilty of domestic violence against his girlfriend Heidi Fleiss, per <a href=#>NBC News</a>. He was arrested twice in 2009 and 2011 for the suspected battery of a woman. In 2017, he was charged with domestic abuse towards his girlfriend. That same year, an article came out by <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> detailing <a href=#>Sizemore's sexual abuse of an 11-year-old actor.</a></p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
